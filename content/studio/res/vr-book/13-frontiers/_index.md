We arrive at the final chapter, which surveys some topics that could influence widespread VR usage in the future, but are currently in a research and development stage. Sections [13.1](http://lavalle.pl/vr/node435.htmlnode436.html#sec:haptics) and [13.2](http://lavalle.pl/vr/node435.htmlnode445.html#sec:smell) cover the forgotten senses. Earlier in this book, we covered vision, hearing, and balance (vestibular) senses, which leaves touch, smell, and taste. Section [13.1](http://lavalle.pl/vr/node435.htmlnode436.html#sec:haptics) covers touch, or more generally, the _somatosensory system_. This includes physiology, perception, and engineering technology that stimulates the somatosensory system. Section [13.2](http://lavalle.pl/vr/node435.htmlnode445.html#sec:smell) covers the two _chemical senses_, smell and taste, along with attempts to engineer ''displays'' for them. Section [13.3](http://lavalle.pl/vr/node435.htmlnode450.html#sec:robots) discusses how robots are used for telepresence and how they may ultimately become our _surrogate selves_ through which the real world can be explored with a VR interface. Just like there are avatars in a virtual world (Section [10.4](http://lavalle.pl/vr/node435.htmlnode331.html#sec:social)), the robot becomes a kind of physical avatar in the real world. Finally, Section [13.4](http://lavalle.pl/vr/node435.htmlnode458.html#sec:bmi) discusses steps toward the ultimate level of human augmentation and interaction: Brain-machine interfaces.
