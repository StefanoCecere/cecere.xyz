{{< figure src="/img/StefanoCecere_photo_500.jpg" width="200" class="floatright">}}

Named Stefano Cecere since born in mid &#8217;70 Italy.

Grown up with hands on computer and piano keyboards

Involved in the meaning of Life, the universe and everything

Can&#8217;t tolerate human pain and suffering

Always staring at starry night sky and willing to die free in space

Molecular body can be found somewhere on Earth (mostly in Florence&#8217;s hills)

It&#8217;s worth to play a good life and die happy

Sharing things and idea, more than keeping them for the coffin

Caring about all children, not just beloved generated ones

Technology produces [tools](http://stefanocecere.com/tech/ "Tech") to be used for a purpose, the higher the better

Lovely crafting games, songs and media for new human souls @ [KRUR.com](http://krur.com)
