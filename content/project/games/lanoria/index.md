# Voy a La Noria Game

![](./screenshot_home.jpg)

Voy a La Noria is a puzzle game in which we simulate the work carried out by the La Noria Social Innovation Center in the province of Malaga. In each game we will have to try to achieve the maximum social impact in the province of Malaga, locating different projects so that they carry out their work optimally and have the greatest possible social impact in the territory.
