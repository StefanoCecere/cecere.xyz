i started coding (basic, assembler and Machine Code) with the Commodore 64.
But it was the Amiga 500 that opened my multimedia passion.

While in high school, i learned to develop and worked on several Amiga video games with Lindasoft publisher.
mostly AMOS (the Amiga version of STOS), a precursor of Director.

here are some titles i could still find :)

## Hypnotic Land (1990)
